  <p>Hello world! This is HTML5 Boilerplate. Hellooooooo</p>
  <p>Apple claims it has found a software solution to the court injunction which recently banned some of its older iPhones from being sold in China. In a statement to Reuters the company said it would be issuing a software update “early next week” which it believes will address “the minor functionality of the two patents at issue in the case.” If the courts agree, this update will mean that Apple can continue to sell the iPhones affected by the ban, which include the iPhone 6S, 6S Plus, 7, 7 Plus, 8, 8 Plus, and X.</p>
  <p>Apple was recently found to be infringing upon two of Qualcomm’s patents in China, which were reportedly relating to resizing pictures and managing applications. When the ban was first announced, Apple claimed to CNBC that iOS 12 — the most recent version of its software — does not infringe on those patents. If true, then issuing an update to force the affected iPhone models to update to iOS 12 could be enough to reverse the decision. Apple has already filed a request for reconsideration in China over the ban.</p>
